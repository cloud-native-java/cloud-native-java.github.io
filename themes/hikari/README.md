# Hikari theme

Hikari is a simple theme for bloggers, whose minimalism tries to focus readers on the content. It's a port of [Mathieu Mayer-Mazzoli](//github.com/mx3m)'s orignal [Hikari theme](//github.com/mx3m/hikari-for-Jekyll) made for Jekyll. Noteworthy features are the integration of a comment-system powered by Disqus, optional statistics via Google Analytics, support for RSS and syntax highlighting for source code in blog posts.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone git@github.com:digitalcraftsman/hugo-hikari-theme.git

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Setup

### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-hikari-theme/tree/dev/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-hikari-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-hikari-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change strings as you like to customize your website.

### Disqus

This theme features a comment system powered by Disqus too. Just add your Disqus-shortname to the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-hikari-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) and let readers respond to your blog posts.

### Google Analytics

In order to get statistics about your blog and it's visitors, just enter your tracking code in the corresponding field in the [configs](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-hikari-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml). As with Disqus, the use of Google Analytics is completely optional.

### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server -w

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
