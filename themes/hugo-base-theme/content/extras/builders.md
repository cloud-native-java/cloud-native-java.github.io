Hugo provides the functionality to quickly get a site, theme or page
started.


## New Site

Want to get a site built quickly?

    hugo new site /path/to/site

Hugo will create all the needed directories and files to get started
quickly.

Hugo will only touch the files and create the directories (in the right
places), [configuration](/overview/configuration) and content are up to
you... but luckily we have builders for content (see below).

## New Theme

Want to design a new theme?

    hugo new theme `THEME_NAME`

Run from your working directory, this will create a new theme with all
the needed files in your themes directory. Hugo will provide you with a
license and theme.toml file with most of the work done for you.

Follow the [Theme Creation Guide](/themes/creation) once the builder is
done.

## New Content

You will use this builder the most of all. Every time you want to create
a new piece of content, the content builder will get you started right.

Leveraging [content archetypes](/content/archetypes) the content builder
will not only insert the current date and appropriate metadata, but it
will pre-populate values based on the content type.

    hugo new relative/path/to/content

This assumes it is being run from your working directory and the content
path starts from your content directory.

I typically keep two different terminals open, one to run `hugo server
--watch`, and another to use the builders to create new content.
