Please make certain you have installed the themes you want to use in the
/themes directory.

To use a theme for a site:

    hugo -t ThemeName

The ThemeName must match the name of the directory inside /themes

Hugo will then apply the theme first, then apply anything that is in the local
directory. To learn more, goto [customizing themes](/themes/customizing)
