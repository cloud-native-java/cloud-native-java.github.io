# HTML 5 Theme for Hugo

HTML5 theme for the static site generator [Hugo](http://http://hugo.spf13.com).
It is not a complete theme but rather a set of templates that generates the necessary HTML. It also contains some sensible CSS reset.
It requires the end user to provide their custom design through CSS files.
