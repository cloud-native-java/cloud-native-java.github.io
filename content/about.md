This blog is meant to showcase the ongoing discussion around the Cloud Native Architecture and, hopefully, to serve as a sounding board for our upcoming O'Reilly book [_Cloud Native Java_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038252.do)  by [Josh Long](http://twitter.com/starbuxman) and [Kenny Bastani](http://twitter.com/kennybastani).

The bird picture, for those of you wondering, is a [Blue-Eared Kingfisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-eared_kingfisher) from the island of Java.
