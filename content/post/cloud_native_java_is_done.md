After just a bit more than two years since the original post to this portal went up, we're pleased to say that _Cloud Native Java_ is now available! It's [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Java-Designing-Resilient/dp/1449374646/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503905875&sr=8-1&keywords=cloud+native+java#customerReviews) and wherever fine books are sold!

It's been a long journey but we're so glad to see the finish line and we hope you dig it too.
